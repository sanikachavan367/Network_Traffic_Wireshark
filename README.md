# Network_Traffic_Wireshark
Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture and inspect data packets traveling through a network. It helps in monitoring network traffic, analyzing protocols (like TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS), and detecting anomalies or suspicious activity.
Basic Steps: 
  1. Open Wireshark and select the network interface.
  2. Start capturing packets in real-time.
  3. Use filters to focus on specific traffic (e.g., http, tcp).
  4. Analyze packet details such as source, destination, protocol, and payload.
  5. Stop capture and save logs for further analysis.
Use Cases:
  1. Network troubleshooting
  2. Security monitoring
  3. Learning network protocols
  4. Detecting malware or suspicious connections
